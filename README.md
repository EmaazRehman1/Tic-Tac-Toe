# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project implements the core logic of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game along with:
1) An AI player using the Minimax algorithm.
2) An optimized AI player using Alpha-Beta Pruning.
It also compares the performance between the standard Minimax and the Alpha-Beta Pruning optimized Minimax.
